A **Shard of Godhood** is one of seven shards of immense strength, each granting an ultimate affinity to the respective [[The World As We Know It - Adalbrecht Hugh/Religion/Gods of Olympus\|god]]'s element.
- Shard of Fire
- Shard of Water
- Shard of Earth
- Shard of Wind
- Shard of Lightning
- Shard of Darkness
- Shard of Light

The individual who is successfully attuned to one of these shards becomes the [[The World As We Know It - Adalbrecht Hugh/Avatars\|Avatar]] of that element until he is ridden of the shard.

Many years have been spent searching for just one of these shards, but none have ever been reported found, yet there is proof of [[The World As We Know It - Adalbrecht Hugh/Avatars\|Avatars]] existing.
