**Education** in [[The World As We Know It - Adalbrecht Hugh/The Nations/The Lands of Gehenna\|Gehenna]] is sparse, most countries only grant to their people a single year, or sometimes two, of education in school. These schools serve to teach the population how to read and write [[The World As We Know It - Adalbrecht Hugh/Ghessan\|Ghessan]], however, locally some schools do teach more specific variations of the language, such as **elvish**, **goblin**, **dwarven**, et cetera. Regardless, most races come to know how to speak and listen to their language via their peers and family in their villages, which rarely guarantees any capabilities of writing or reading.
