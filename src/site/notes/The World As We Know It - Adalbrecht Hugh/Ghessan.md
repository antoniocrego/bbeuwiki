One of the oldest languages; as different peoples began to inhabit common spaces and work together, creating races such as the [[Half-Elves\|Half-Elves]], older groups of languages such as [[Ancient Elvish\|Ancient Elvish]], converged into this language, creating a sort of universal language, or **common language**.

Most other languages, however, kept evolving alongside **Ghessan**, adopting some terms from **Ghessan** and, by consequence, from other languages, into the modern versions of the languages.
