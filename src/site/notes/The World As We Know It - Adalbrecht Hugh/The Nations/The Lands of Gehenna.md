**The Lands of Gehenna**, or simply **Gehenna**, are the group of landmasses which constitute our world. It is where we live and where nations are formed. The following map represents the current estimated appearance of the world. It lacks accuracy in some aspects due to how large the world is, and since it is done from the perspective of a [[The World As We Know It - Adalbrecht Hugh/The Nations/Lothria/Lothrian\|Lothrian]] scribe as of [[The World As We Know It - Adalbrecht Hugh/The General Timeline/PC 533 - Francia is Victorious\|PC 533]].

[[The World As We Know It - Adalbrecht Hugh/The Islands of Caelum\|The Floating Islands of Caelum]] are not represented on this map since their positions very slightly sway and we lack the knowledge of them to properly map them, while also possibly obscuring the view of the nations in the map, but they are distributed along the entirety of **Gehenna**. 

There are thirteen major nations in **Gehenna**, which are very often reflected in the works of [[Sir Camões\|Sir Camões]] of [[The World As We Know It - Adalbrecht Hugh/The Nations/Bel'orizonte/Bel'orizonte\|Bel'orizonte]].
- [[The World As We Know It - Adalbrecht Hugh/The Nations/Francia/Francia\|Francia]] - France/Italy

- [[The World As We Know It - Adalbrecht Hugh/The Nations/Österreich/Österreich\|Österreich]] - Austria

- [[The World As We Know It - Adalbrecht Hugh/The Nations/Veridian Reach/Veridian Reach\|Veridian Reach]] - United States of America/United Kingdom
- [[The World As We Know It - Adalbrecht Hugh/The Nations/The Independent Imperial Province of Rosaria/The Independent Imperial Province of Rosaria\|The Independent Imperial Province of Rosaria]] - Vatican City
- [[The World As We Know It - Adalbrecht Hugh/The Nations/Lothria/Lothria\|Lothria]] - Ancient Rome/Burgundy
- [[The World As We Know It - Adalbrecht Hugh/The Nations/The Kingdom of Shinsoo/The Kingdom of Shinsoo\|The Kingdom of Shinsoo]] - Japan

- [[The World As We Know It - Adalbrecht Hugh/The Nations/The Rebel Province of Horizon/The Rebel Province of Horizon\|The Rebel Province of Horizon]] - African colonies such as Algeria, Mozambique, Angola, et cetera
- [[The World As We Know It - Adalbrecht Hugh/The Nations/Nordea/Nordea\|Nordea]] - Nordic nations like Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Finland, and their mythologies
- [[The World As We Know It - Adalbrecht Hugh/The Nations/Ung/Ung\|Ung]] - Not really mentioned in the works of [[Sir Camões\|Sir Camões]]... unless you wish to make racist remarks, then I'm sure you can find plenty of "parallels"

There is a fourteenth nation, technically, although it is not populated by any - well - civilized people. It is a very unstructured society and has such been dubbed [[The World As We Know It - Adalbrecht Hugh/The Nations/The Wild Islands of Saint Michael/The Wild Islands of Saint Michael\|The Wild Islands of Saint Michael]]. The same can be told for [[The World As We Know It - Adalbrecht Hugh/The Nations/The Underdark/The Underdark\|The Underdark]], a pseudo-nation which lies under the lands of Gehenna, but is known for its presence of criminal activity and mining operations, thus not possessing a theoretical official government ether.

Before [[The World As We Know It - Adalbrecht Hugh/The General Timeline/PC 533 - Francia is Victorious\|PC 533]], the map of the world was very different, notably changed by [[The World As We Know It - Adalbrecht Hugh/The General Timeline/PC 529 - The Francian War Machine kicks off\|the start of the Francian expansion]] and [[The World As We Know It - Adalbrecht Hugh/The General Timeline/PC 532 - Horizon Rises\|the rise of Horizon]].
