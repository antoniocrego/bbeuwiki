Nordea is a nation in the northwest of the central mass of [[The World As We Know It - Adalbrecht Hugh/The Nations/The Lands of Gehenna\|The Lands of Gehenna]], known for its icy and snowy plains, and deep forests of magical trees capable of growing on ice. The nation is ruled by an assembly of leaders from different tribes, generating great tension on highly debatable topics, such as foreign affairs.

Although the tribes tend to collaborate and do not participate in acts of aggression against each other, there have been conflicts in Nordea, including some with smaller tribes which do not agree with the ruling method. This disagreement has manifested as minor revolts and terror attacks.
