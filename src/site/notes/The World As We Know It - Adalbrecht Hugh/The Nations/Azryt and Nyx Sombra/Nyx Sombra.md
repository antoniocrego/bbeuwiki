The shadowed, corrupted remnants of the fallen [[The World As We Know It - Adalbrecht Hugh/The Nations/Azryt and Nyx Sombra/Azryt\|Azryt]] empire, twisted by the [[The World As We Know It - Adalbrecht Hugh/Planes of Existence/The Abyss/The Abyss\|The Abyss]]. The isles are haunted by storms, shadows, and the [[The World As We Know It - Adalbrecht Hugh/Planes of Existence/The Abyss/Children of the Abyss/Children of the Abyss\|Children of the Abyss]], where once-proud citadels and temples now lie in ruin.
The lands have been covered in dense [[The World As We Know It - Adalbrecht Hugh/Planes of Existence/The Abyss/Black Breath\|Black Breath]], making mapping of the area and breathing particularly hard.
