The plane of existence where souls pass after death, a shadowed and enigmatic realm of transition. It is the domain of [[The World As We Know It - Adalbrecht Hugh/Religion/Gods/Current Gods/Barnabas, the Demon\|Barnabas, the Demon]].

Aviici is layered, with shifting regions and levels that respond to the nature of the soul. Higher levels are luminous and open, resonating with clarity, reflection, or harmony, while the deeper regions are dense, turbulent, and oppressive, echoing turmoil, unresolved impulses, or inner strife. Souls that linger too long in the deepest layers can mutate into unrecognizable beings of sin, desire, or obsession. These creatures are extremely unlikely to ever escape Aviici, but on rare occasions they have, either by breaking through the dividing plane or being summoned by mortals. One of these creatures, [[Divine General Makora\|Divine General Makora]] is a notorious figure, a twisted echo of ambition and cruelty, whose appearances are whispered about in fear.

It is said that these demons can be bound or even controlled by mortals, but such feats are extraordinarily dangerous and rarely successful.
