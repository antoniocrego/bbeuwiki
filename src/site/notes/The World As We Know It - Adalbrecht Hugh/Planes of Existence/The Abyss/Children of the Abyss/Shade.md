A type of [[The World As We Know It - Adalbrecht Hugh/Planes of Existence/The Abyss/Children of the Abyss/Children of the Abyss\|Children of the Abyss]] and the third stage of [[The World As We Know It - Adalbrecht Hugh/Planes of Existence/The Abyss/Corruption\|Corruption]], characterized by complete takeover of the body by [[The World As We Know It - Adalbrecht Hugh/Magic and Mana/Mana Types/Abyssal Mana\|Abyssal Mana]] density spots and complete cognitive shutdown.
These [[The World As We Know It - Adalbrecht Hugh/Planes of Existence/The Abyss/Children of the Abyss/Children of the Abyss\|Children of the Abyss]] can hardly be called living beings anymore, being essentially equal to a [[The World As We Know It - Adalbrecht Hugh/Planes of Existence/The Abyss/Children of the Abyss/Whisper\|Whisper]], but very minor spots of the brain and living tissue may still be present. This, as a consequence, causes the shades to call out for help in long drawn-out gasps.
