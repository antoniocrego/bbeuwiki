Beings who have been [[The World As We Know It - Adalbrecht Hugh/Planes of Existence/The Abyss/Corruption\|corrupted]] by [[The World As We Know It - Adalbrecht Hugh/Planes of Existence/The Abyss/The Abyss\|The Abyss]], or entirely originate from [[The World As We Know It - Adalbrecht Hugh/Magic and Mana/Mana Types/Abyssal Mana\|Abyssal Mana]]. Their appearance is often covered in dark spots, and they ooze [[The World As We Know It - Adalbrecht Hugh/Planes of Existence/The Abyss/Black Breath\|Black Breath]].
These beings can be placed into four categories, depending on their source and level of corruption:
- [[The World As We Know It - Adalbrecht Hugh/Planes of Existence/The Abyss/Children of the Abyss/Hollow\|Hollow]]
- [[The World As We Know It - Adalbrecht Hugh/Planes of Existence/The Abyss/Children of the Abyss/Lost\|Lost]]
- [[The World As We Know It - Adalbrecht Hugh/Planes of Existence/The Abyss/Children of the Abyss/Shade\|Shade]]
- [[The World As We Know It - Adalbrecht Hugh/Planes of Existence/The Abyss/Children of the Abyss/Whisper\|Whisper]]
The children of the Abyss are often seen roaming senselessly, especially in the later stages of corruption. They are also quite aggressive to any creatures which are not of abyssal nature, unhinging their jaws to bite and claw at enemies.
