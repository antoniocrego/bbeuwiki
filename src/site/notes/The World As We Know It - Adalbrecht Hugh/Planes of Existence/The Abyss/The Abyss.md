> *"The source of all of the mortal plane's agony, greed, sickness, and sin, and its resting place too."*
> *Unknown Writer*, circa PC 24

A dark, twisted plane of existence that exists alongside the mortal realm and the afterlife. Unlike [[The World As We Know It - Adalbrecht Hugh/Planes of Existence/Aviici/Aviici\|Aviici]], it is not a realm of orderly transition, but a roiling pool of unfulfilled ambition, obsession, and agony. Souls who commit acts of unimaginable cruelty or fall into extreme obsession may be drawn here instead of [[The World As We Know It - Adalbrecht Hugh/Planes of Existence/Aviici/Aviici\|Aviici]], where their essence is warped and consumed.

The Abyss bridges both [[The World As We Know It - Adalbrecht Hugh/Planes of Existence/Aviici/Aviici\|Aviici]] and the material plane, leaking into certain regions, where its touch twists the land, spawns [[The World As We Know It - Adalbrecht Hugh/Planes of Existence/The Abyss/Children of the Abyss/Children of the Abyss\|Children of the Abyss]], and manifests horrors that defy natural law. It is alien, chaotic, and indifferent, and those who linger risk losing all vestiges of their former selves to madness or transformation.

Some say that secretive organizations have deliberately fed the Abyss, deepening its influence and using it as a tool to corrupt the world.
