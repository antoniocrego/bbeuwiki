Corruption describes the level of [[The World As We Know It - Adalbrecht Hugh/Magic and Mana/Mana Types/Abyssal Mana\|Abyssal Mana]] present in a living being's body, often from ingesting [[The World As We Know It - Adalbrecht Hugh/Planes of Existence/The Abyss/Black Breath\|Black Breath]] emitted by [[The World As We Know It - Adalbrecht Hugh/Planes of Existence/The Abyss/Children of the Abyss/Children of the Abyss\|Children of the Abyss]].
It follows a natural progression in 3 stages:
- [[The World As We Know It - Adalbrecht Hugh/Planes of Existence/The Abyss/Children of the Abyss/Hollow\|Hollow]] - Cognitive functions remain, and some steel-hearted individuals may still maintain sanity. Black spots begin to emerge across the body.
- [[The World As We Know It - Adalbrecht Hugh/Planes of Existence/The Abyss/Children of the Abyss/Lost\|Lost]] - Appearance changes drastically as the abyss consumes most of the body, including sections of the brain. Cognitive capabilities are drastically reduced, but they can still be heard clinging to emotions of their past lives and screaming for loved ones or other words.
- [[The World As We Know It - Adalbrecht Hugh/Planes of Existence/The Abyss/Children of the Abyss/Shade\|Shade]] - Functionally and appearance-wise these creatures are identical to [[The World As We Know It - Adalbrecht Hugh/Planes of Existence/The Abyss/Children of the Abyss/Whisper\|Whisper]]s, roaming senselessly and resorting to merely instinct. However, you can often still hear them calling for help...
If the being never was a living creature and is completely composed of [[The World As We Know It - Adalbrecht Hugh/Magic and Mana/Mana Types/Abyssal Mana\|Abyssal Mana]], then it is known as a [[The World As We Know It - Adalbrecht Hugh/Planes of Existence/The Abyss/Children of the Abyss/Whisper\|Whisper]]. In the case of uncertain identification, utilize the term [[Child of the Abyss\|Child of the Abyss]] or [[The World As We Know It - Adalbrecht Hugh/Planes of Existence/The Abyss/Children of the Abyss/Whisper\|Whisper]].
