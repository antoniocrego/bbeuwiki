**The Miaom Calendar** was created by Sir Qi Miaom of the [[The World As We Know It - Adalbrecht Hugh/The Nations/The Kingdom of Shinsoo/The Kingdom of Shinsoo\|The Kingdom of Shinsoo]] and aptly named after himself. The Miaom Calendar further expands the knowledge of the passing of time by granting titles to days in a week, to months, and defining the notion of a year with [[The World As We Know It - Adalbrecht Hugh/Time/Seasons/Seasons\|Seasons]].

The Miaom Calendar titles the seven days of the week as such:
1. Nephira
2. Tartalion
3. Chronor
4. Zephyris
5. Azuran
6. Barnadun
7. Mythorian

Qi Miaom was a firm believer of the [[The World As We Know It - Adalbrecht Hugh/Religion/Filli Caeli\|Filli Caeli]] religion, and so he named the days of the week after the [[The World As We Know It - Adalbrecht Hugh/Religion/Gods of Olympus\|Gods of Olympus]].

However, the concept of a week was far too granular, and so Miaom studied grander defining moments in a year. And so, he looked at the stars and noticed their positions changed ever so slightly with time, thus he would trace one star until it returned to its original position, and that amount of days would be a year. 397 days it took for that moment to come, and thus a year was defined as 397 days.

In Miaom's time, the rate of literacy and significant education was far too low, and commonfolk could not understand his calendar when it came to be adopted by the [[The World As We Know It - Adalbrecht Hugh/The Nations/The Kingdom of Shinsoo/The Kingdom of Shinsoo\|The Kingdom of Shinsoo]]. Simply put, the number of the day would get into realms far too high for anyone to know how to read. The initial solution was to divide the year into periods of 57 weeks, and in those weeks, you could then specify the day, either as, for example, 24-3, for the third day of the twenty-fourth week, or as 24-Chronor.

Miaom had passed away by the time this calendar representation became common knowledge, but scholars recognized a fatal flaw in the representation: the year did not always end as the 57th week ended, causing years to be treated by commonfolk as 399 days instead of the correct 397. This could be acceptable, but it would cause a noticeable offset between specific weather conditions throughout the years.

Thus, the at the time king of [[The World As We Know It - Adalbrecht Hugh/The Nations/Lothria/Lothria\|Lothria]] ruled that the year be instead divided into months, groups of pre-defined amounts of days. This concept, in time, would eclipse the notion of weeks, but weeks remain in use for referring to smaller time intervals.
The king of [[The World As We Know It - Adalbrecht Hugh/The Nations/Lothria/Lothria\|Lothria]] named these months after a group of [[Legendary Adventurers\|Legendary Adventurers]] which graced his presence many years before. The duration of these months, however, were made to sync with specific holidays in [[The World As We Know It - Adalbrecht Hugh/The Nations/Lothria/Lothria\|Lothria]]. Thus, in the kingdom, every month begins on a holiday originated before the Miaom Calendar in its most recent form. Notably, some of these holidays define the start of the [[The World As We Know It - Adalbrecht Hugh/Time/Seasons/Seasons\|Seasons]], which were utilized by farmers familiarized with the state of soil in different points of the year, important for growing different seasonal vegetables and fruits.

1. [[The World As We Know It - Adalbrecht Hugh/Time/Months/Luminara\|Luminara]] - 44 days - Winter - starts with the [[Birth of Lothria\|Birth of Lothria]] holiday.
2. [[The World As We Know It - Adalbrecht Hugh/Time/Months/Pandemonis\|Pandemonis]] - 45 days - Spring - starts with the [[Springdawn\|Springdawn]] holiday.
3. [[The World As We Know It - Adalbrecht Hugh/Time/Months/Cinderveil\|Cinderveil]] - 41 days - Spring - starts with the [[The World As We Know It - Adalbrecht Hugh/The Nations/Lothria/Holidays/Ashenbloom Festival\|Ashenbloom Festival]] holiday.
4. [[The World As We Know It - Adalbrecht Hugh/Time/Months/Bishamon\|Bishamon]] - 45 days - Summer - starts with the [[Cinderlight\|Cinderlight]] holiday.
5. [[The World As We Know It - Adalbrecht Hugh/Time/Months/Regnum\|Regnum]] - 45 days - Summer - starts with the [[Institution of Reign\|Institution of Reign]] holiday.
6. [[The World As We Know It - Adalbrecht Hugh/Time/Months/Jovialis\|Jovialis]] - 45 days - Summer - starts with the [[Sunspire Day\|Sunspire Day]] holiday.
7. [[The World As We Know It - Adalbrecht Hugh/Time/Months/Tempestra\|Tempestra]] - 40 days - Autumn - starts with the [[Thunderbreak\|Thunderbreak]] holiday.
8. [[The World As We Know It - Adalbrecht Hugh/Time/Months/Oddleap\|Oddleap]] - 40 days - Autumn - starts with the [[The World As We Know It - Adalbrecht Hugh/The Nations/Lothria/Holidays/Harvest Moon Gala\|Harvest Moon Gala]] holiday.
9. [[The World As We Know It - Adalbrecht Hugh/Time/Months/Pantheonix\|Pantheonix]] - 52 days - Winter - starts with the [[Natalis\|Natalis]] holiday.

And so, the current calendar was born, representing dates as such:
- Tartalion, 23rd of Bishamon, 541 PC

Humorously, the PC literally means "Post Counting", which is when Sir Qi Miaom invented the calendar and began the count of years.
