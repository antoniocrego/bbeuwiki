The year is divided into **four seasons**, each defined not merely by climate but by ancient mythologies and celestial alignments that shape the world's balance.

Initially these seasons were defined by [[The World As We Know It - Adalbrecht Hugh/The Nations/Lothria/Lothrian\|Lothrian]] farmers and the effects of weather on possible crops and yields. Later on they were popularized by [[The World As We Know It - Adalbrecht Hugh/Time/The Miaom Calendar\|The Miaom Calendar]], which utilizes these seasons as a basis for its months.

Each season holds a unique cultural and divine significance, tied to the influence of gods, elemental forces, and historical events.

The world's seasons are tied intrinsically to its gods and myths, creating a cyclical interplay between mortals, nature, and the divine. Each season is more than a change in weather; it is a chapter in the story of balance, struggle, and survival.
