**Winter** begins with [[The World As We Know It - Adalbrecht Hugh/Time/Months/Pantheonix\|Pantheonix]], the darkest yet most spiritually resonant time of the year. It is said that during [[The World As We Know It - Adalbrecht Hugh/Time/Months/Pantheonix\|Pantheonix]], the goddess of starlight weaves a celestial tapestry, covering the skies with guiding constellations to lead mortals through long nights. [[The World As We Know It - Adalbrecht Hugh/Time/Months/Luminara\|Luminara]], the second month of winter, celebrates rebirth and resilience. It embodies the fiery resurgence of life as it pushes back the frozen grip of winter.
