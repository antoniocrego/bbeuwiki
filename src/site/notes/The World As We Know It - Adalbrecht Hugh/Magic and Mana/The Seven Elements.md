The seven elements are the basic elements from which all magic originates, defined by the remaining [[The World As We Know It - Adalbrecht Hugh/Religion/Gods of Olympus\|Gods]] in [[The World As We Know It - Adalbrecht Hugh/Religion/The Shattering\|The Shattering]]. The gods left their [[The World As We Know It - Adalbrecht Hugh/Shard of Godhood\|Shards of Godhood]] scattered through the lands, and it is said that these shards allowed mortals to learn how to manipulate their innate mana into magic. These shards then defined the following elements:
- [[Fire\|Fire]]
- [[Water\|Water]]
- [[Earth\|Earth]]
- [[Wind\|Wind]]
- [[Lightning\|Lightning]]
- [[Darkness\|Darkness]]
- [[Light\|Light]]

All magic exists through careful manipulation and tweaking of these elements and respective [[Mana\|Mana]] amounts, leading to convoluted and complicated recipes for each spell. However, mortals have evolved to abstract these deep layers of manipulation and simplify magic greatly.
