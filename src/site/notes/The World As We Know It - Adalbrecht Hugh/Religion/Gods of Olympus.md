The **Gods of Olympus** are the 7 gods which are worshipped by many and in different capacities; For worship, refer to [[The World As We Know It - Adalbrecht Hugh/Religion/Religion\|Religion]]. They have a grand control of different parts of the world as we know it, and are many times known by monikers originated from tales of their presence and effect on the world, and the abilities they demonstrated.

- God of Fire - [[Nephastus, the Trickster\|Nephastus, the Trickster]]
- God of Water - [[Tartaglia, the Vengeful\|Tartaglia, the Vengeful]]
- God of Earth, Contracts, Time - [[Chronos, the Punished\|Chronos, the Punished]]
- God of Wind, Love, Freedom - [[Zephyros, the Lost\|Zephyros, the Lost]]
- God of Lightning, War - [[Azula, the Fallen\|Azula, the Fallen]]
- God of Darkness and Aviici - [[Barnabas, the Demon\|Barnabas, the Demon]]
- God of Light - [[Mythos, the Betrayed\|Mythos, the Betrayed]]

Some of these gods are younger than others, as tales of way back when tell of different names and titles for some of them. [[Barnabas, the Demon\|Barnabas]] and [[Chronos, the Punished\|Chronos]] are the oldest, with little knowledge of which is older as there's no discerning evidence of one existing at a time where the other did not.

An example of a [[Fallen God\|Fallen God]] is [[Tartaglia, the Vengeful\|Tartaglia]], texts of around 84 PC tell of the God of Water being one [[Aquillios\|Aquillios]], so it is assumed that god must have died and given way to [[Tartaglia, the Vengeful\|Tartaglia]], this being a possible story for his rise in much literature.
Another example is [[Azula, the Fallen\|Azula, the Fallen]], as the name implies. She is not a fairly young god, there are tales of her that go far back, but there is a period of time where literature indicates she had fallen and another known as [[Iroh\|Iroh]] had taken her place, but a few years later, literature indicates that [[Azula, the Fallen\|Azula]] never stopped being a god, causing an intriguing yet confusing tidbit of history of unknown nature.

Some texts of old claim the existence of an eighth unknown god, specifically texts that have links to the [[Islands of Caelum\|Islands of Caelum]], but even the literature that claims the existence of the god is inconsistent as to its identity, so it is hard to know for sure. Perhaps it is a contested position.
