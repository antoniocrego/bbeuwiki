The **Apex Divinitas** is a position of ultimate power among the [[The World As We Know It - Adalbrecht Hugh/Religion/Gods of Olympus\|Gods]].

This position can be assumed by the god who remains after a bloody war, the first of such having been [[The World As We Know It - Adalbrecht Hugh/Religion/The Shattering\|The Shattering]], where no god emerged victorious, and thus no **Apex Divinitas** rose.

One day, [[The World As We Know It - Adalbrecht Hugh/Religion/The War of Reckoning\|The War of Reckoning]], a continuation to [[The World As We Know It - Adalbrecht Hugh/Religion/The Shattering\|The Shattering]], will most surely take place, as attaining this position is an **ultimate goal** for the gods.

The god who stands victorious in [[The World As We Know It - Adalbrecht Hugh/Religion/The War of Reckoning\|The War of Reckoning]] will claim the title of [[The World As We Know It - Adalbrecht Hugh/Religion/Apex Divinitas\|Apex Divinitas]], with no **council of gods** to argue against their ultimate decisions. With this position a true new world order can be achieved.
