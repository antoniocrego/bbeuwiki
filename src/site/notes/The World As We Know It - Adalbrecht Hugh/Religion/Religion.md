**Religion** in [[The World As We Know It - Adalbrecht Hugh/The Nations/The Lands of Gehenna\|Gehenna]] is largely related to the [[The World As We Know It - Adalbrecht Hugh/Religion/Gods of Olympus\|Gods of Olympus]], many people choosing to worship one god in particular or all of them at once.

Most people are religious, however, some choose to not worship any gods; not because they do not believe in their existence, as it is nearly assured that gods do exist, but because they do not find the gods worth worshipping.
