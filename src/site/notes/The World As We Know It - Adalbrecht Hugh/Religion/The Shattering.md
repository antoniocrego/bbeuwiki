**The Shattering** was a war that took place eons ago. It was a war fought by young and ambitious [[The World As We Know It - Adalbrecht Hugh/Religion/Gods of Olympus\|gods]] who sought to be the one and only, the [[The World As We Know It - Adalbrecht Hugh/Religion/Apex Divinitas\|Apex Divinitas]].

This war left an unforgettable scar on the world, causing gods to come to be wary of starting a war of such scale again. Yet, the desire for that position remains, and the possibility of a second war, [[The World As We Know It - Adalbrecht Hugh/Religion/The War of Reckoning\|The War of Reckoning]], remains.

The clashing of these young gods formed canyons, rivers of water and lava, fissures in reality itself. The effect of this war set back humanity thousands of years, and is said to have wiped out many a species, including great species of dragons which fought alongside the gods.

The war was so bloody that no god rose victorious. It's unclear which gods survived this war, and if any still live to this day, but traces of [[The World As We Know It - Adalbrecht Hugh/Religion/Gods/Chronos, the Punished\|Chronos, the Punished]] emerge shortly after the war, so you could make the assumption that the God of Earth died then, and [[The World As We Know It - Adalbrecht Hugh/Religion/Gods/Chronos, the Punished\|Chronos]] took his place.

### Shards of Godhood
An effect of this grand war was the creation of the [[The World As We Know It - Adalbrecht Hugh/Shard of Godhood\|Shards of Godhood]], chunks of great power which were quite literally knocked out of the gods in **The Shattering**.
